<i>Someone once said</i>

3
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:43,375
<i>life is like a jigsaw puzzle.</i>

4
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:48,625
<i>From our best memories</i>

5
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:53,833
<i>to the horrible experiences</i>
<i>we want to curse fate for</i>

6
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:57,708
<i>are all irreplaceable pieces of our lives.</i>

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,166
<i>A lost ticket,</i>

8
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,416
<i>a dress worn in December,</i>

9
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:05,958
Thank you.

10
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,458
<i>A stain from an ink called "Blue Hour."</i>

11
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,791
<i>An intimate moment on a winter beach.</i>

12
00:01:16,708 --> 00:01:18,833
<i>A Mars rover with your name on it.</i>

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,750
<i>A pop star your own age.</i>

14
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:26,333
<i>Dreams that never came true.</i>

15
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:29,875
<i>Failed romances.</i>

16
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,791
<i>Those who drifted away.</i>

17
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:41,500
<i>Even those fateful mistakes,</i>

18
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:45,208
<i>are they filling up my picture?</i>

19
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:48,125
Good morning, everyone.

20
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:54,291
This is Norn Airlines flight 627
bound for Reykjavik.

21
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:57,000
This is flight 627.

22
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:58,625
I'll be your--

23
00:01:58,708 --> 00:01:59,916
Morning, Yae.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,375
Good morning.

25
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:03,458
-Have a good day.
-Thank you.

26
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:09,416
I'll be your cabin assistant, Yae Noguchi.

27
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:15,166
According to forecasts, the weather
should be fair for most of the flight,

28
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,208
but please remain in your seats

29
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:22,750
with your seatbelts fastened
in case of sudden turbulence.

30
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:14,541
<i>Please get to Mr. Okada at</i>
<i>the entrance of Tanukikoji 3-chome.</i>

31

<i>What would my life be now</i>

<i>if I had never met you?</i>

34
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,166
Yae! Morning!

35
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,125
Morning.

36
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,875
-I like mild curry.
-Let's have spicy!

37
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,625
Crap, it's Wakui!

38
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,750
This goes on your record.

39
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,333
-Oh, crap!
-Just act natural.

40
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,583
You, freshmen! Come here!

41
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:19,625
For real?

42
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,916
Hurry it up. I can see your knees!

43
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:25,541
Fix it already!

44
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,125
-Out of the way!
-Don't try to hide it.

45
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:32,791
Namiki!

46
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:37,375
Come on! Come on!

47
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:38,916
Namiki!

48
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,208
Thank God!

49
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:15,875
Thank you.

50
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,791
Obuchi asked me.

51
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:23,916
It's Namiki, right?

52
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:28,208
Have we met somewhere before?

53
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:30,875
I got it!

54
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:33,958
You're the one who spilled
the soda at Seicomart.

55
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,708
Nope, that wasn't me.

56
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,291
Thanks.

57
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:47,958
Later.

58
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:04,791
Thanks for that, Noguchi.
You carry that by yourself?

59
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,958
Namiki did.

60
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:08,458
I see.

61
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,375
He's a pretty good guy.

62
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:15,416
Didn't you ask him to?

63
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:17,458
Me?

64
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:19,916
What did I do?

65
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:22,958
Nothing.

66
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,875
…is A.

67
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:32,416
Which means B equals R.

68
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:38,041
We can put A and B on the x-axis,
so we draw them in.

69
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:40,916
A, B…

70
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,625
Kosaka?

71
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:44,541
Yes?

72
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,791
You'll have exams soon.
Make sure you focus.

73
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,166
I'm sorry, sir.

74
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:54,458
A,H is perpendicular to the x-axis, so…

75
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,666
So that girl from the other day.

76
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,875
From the app?

77
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,791
She's 28 and works at a call center.

78
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:09,875
A temp who has to sit there and get
yelled at by customers six days a week.

79
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,750
Know how to bag a girl like that?

80
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:17,416
Mirroring.

81
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:21,541
The girl and the customers
are starving for empathy.

82
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,166
What do you mean?

83
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,750
I'm exhausted,
I had the worst customer today.

84
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,791
Oh, you poor thing.

85
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:30,958
I feel like wine.

86
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:32,875
Oh wow. Me too.

87
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:33,916
Really?

88
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:37,500
When the girl goes to drink, you do too

89
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,916
and place your glass down
at the same time.

90
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,208
After she experiences a moment of peace,

91
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:47,666
she'll be on top of you 30 minutes later.

92
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,583
Good work today.

93
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,041
Ah, I'm tired…

94
00:07:55,125 --> 00:08:00,041
It especially works on ladies over 35
who are tired of the dating game.

95
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:19,958
You ran late today.

96
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,250
Thanks.

97
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,041
I thought the rain would bring in
a bit more business.

98
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,125
Yeah, totally.

99
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:33,041
But I got lucky to get two long rides
during surcharge time.

100
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,833
That's certainly lucky.

101
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:44,458
Hold on…

102
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:45,916
We're in sync.

103
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,958
Is that mirroring?

104
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,916
I heard it from Mr. Togashi.

105
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,458
It's pretty obvious.

106
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,875
Um… Want to grab some dinner?

107
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,291
It'd be my treat since it's payday.

108
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,333
Sorry, I have plans.

109
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:13,750
No, no, no.

110
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,583
I swear that was a coincidence.

111
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,000
It wasn't on purpose.

112
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,666
No, no…

113
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,125
I'm home.

114
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:46,375
Welcome home.

115
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:53,875
<i>To those waking up or going to bed,</i>

116

00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,583
Cusco's so far.

130
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:53,041
Inti Raymi looks awesome.

131
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:10,833

133
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:28,750
Yes.

134
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,416
Okay, got it.

135
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,625
I'll send it tomorrow.

136
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,125
Okay, bye.

137
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:42,625
That's Mr. Kota's, isn't it?

138
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,583
I can do that for you.

139
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,250
Abiko won't be coming again.

140
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:50,375
He's busy with training,
so I arranged for a different tutor.

141
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,750
He didn't tell me.

142
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,458
I heard you didn't do well
on your mid-terms.

143
00:12:56,458 --> 00:13:00,541
This new tutor should be able to teach you
more practical strategies.

144
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,041
Tsuzuru.

145
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,083
You can have your fun.

146
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,083
But keep it to a minimum.

147
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:16,625
Okay.

148
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:22,583
Namiki!

149
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,375
Hey!

150
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:35,750
Namiki's a little scary,
but he's hot, right?

151
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:36,791
-Totally!
-Right?

152
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,375
I had my eye on him.

153
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,750
You think he has a girlfriend?

154
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,875
Don't say that!

155
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,583
Oh? What's that look?

156
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:46,916
Nothing!

157
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,416
No way that's nothing!

158
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,291
-It's nothing.
-Tell me.

159
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,958
Nice pass!

160
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,208
Namiki!

161
00:14:00,833 --> 00:14:03,666
Namiki! So cool!

162
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,250
Namiki!

163
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,125
Mr. Namiki.

164
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:10,583
Mr. Namiki.

165
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,458
Mr. Namiki.

166
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,541
Mr. Namiki.

167
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:23,291
You okay?

168
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,916
Didn't you say you had plans today?

169
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:35,958
Oh, crap!

170
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,250
Kosshi, take care of the rest.

171
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,791
Sorry.

172
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,375
Please.

173
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,875
Thank you.

174
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,875
-You okay?
-Thank you very much.

175
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:03,875
Thanks.

176
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:20,416
Thank you.

177
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,375
Park Hotel, please.

178
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,041
Right away.

179
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:34,958
Excuse me, sir. How's the Fighter's game?

180
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:39,875
It's the top of the third,
and they're beating the Carps by two.

181
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:42,291
I see.

182
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:45,833
I'm sorry!

183
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:52,458
Well, the person I'm about to meet
is a big Carps fan.

184
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,458
It's my girlfriend's dad.

185
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:00,041
I see.

186
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,166
TSUNEMI ARIKAWA

187
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,541
Hello, hello.

188
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,291
I know, I'm on my way now.

189
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,375
And I got a gift for your mom.

190
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:20,750
What?

191
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,041
Sorry, it was a little loud.

192
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:36,958
Sorry.

193
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:39,125
Let's talk later.

194
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,125
Sorry, could you turn it up?

195
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:50,875
No problem.

196
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:55,750
<i>…was the flavor of cigarettes</i>

197
00:16:55,833 --> 00:17:02,375
<i>A bitter taste</i>

198
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:11,250
<i>Around this time tomorrow</i>

199
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:17,500
<i>I wonder where you will be</i>

200
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:24,583
<i>And who you will be thinking of</i>

201
00:17:28,708 --> 00:17:32,458
<i>You are always gonna be my love</i>

202
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:39,041
<i>If one day</i>
<i>I ever fall in love with someone again</i>

203
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:44,708
<i>I'll remember to love</i>
<i>You taught me how</i>

204
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,333
Could you actually go back?

205
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,458
Sorry.

206
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,625
No, I can do that.

207
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:55,291
<i>…still a sad love song</i>

208
00:17:55,375 --> 00:18:01,958
<i>Until I can sing a new one</i>

209
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,500
Sorry to bother you like this.

210
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,541
I know you'll probably be surprised
with what I'm going to say.

211
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:34,166
-Ever since the opening ceremony, I--
-I'm sorry!

212
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,333
Huh?

213
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:39,666
But if you want, maybe we--

214
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,041
I'm flattered, thank you.

215
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,166
-I have movie tickets.
-I'm sorry!

216
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,083
Thank you.

217
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:01,250
Okay, next!

218
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,791
Oh man!

219
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,791
Noguchi is so beautiful!

220
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:18,833
Scandalous!

221
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,916
I heard she's dating
the soccer captain though.

222
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,583
Are you for real?

223
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,916
I heard it was the class president!

224
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,291
Oh, crap!

225
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,916
You okay, Namiki?

226
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,416
Nothing, I'm fine.

227
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,000
How far along are you?

228
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:41,416
I'm due in a week.

229
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:44,250
How exciting.

230
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:48,625
These ten months,

231
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:53,375
every day has felt like Christmas Eve.

232
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:57,583
But when I think it's almost going to end,

233
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,625
makes me a little sad.

234
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,416
Isn't that silly,
just when we can finally meet?

235
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,291
No, not at all.

236
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,625
I'm sure

237
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:14,916
every day will be Christmas
after they're born.

238
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:13,083
Yae, if you'd like, these are for you.

239
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:26,166
There's no weird meaning behind this.

240
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,500
One of my customers gave them to me.

241
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:37,250
Lilacs are my favorite flowers.

242
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:58,083
Women just pick a man
based on their status.

243
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:01,458
You gotta shape up in high school.

244
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:05,791
Obviously, only the smart kids and jocks
get all the girls in high school.

245
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:09,125
Noguchi isn't simple like that.

246
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,541
Yeah, sure, but she's got a man now.

247
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:14,458
Your fault for being too chicken
to ask her out.

248
00:22:15,666 --> 00:22:16,958
Shut up!

249
00:22:20,458 --> 00:22:22,458
Now, now. Settle down.

250
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,083
This will make you feel better.

251
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:28,666
Bonji selection Gold Award.

252
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:36,916
Welcome.

253
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:39,375
Namiki?

254
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,083
PEACH BUTT THIEF

255
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:45,208
This isn't…

256
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:49,833
For how many days?

257
00:22:52,291 --> 00:22:53,291
Just one.

258
00:22:53,375 --> 00:22:54,583
We'll watch it today.

259
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:12,041
Who is the cutest 10-year-old
in the country?

260
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:16,708
Definitely my niece!

261
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:18,250
Harumichi!

262
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:20,625
-My cute Airu!
-Harumichi!

263
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:31,250
She's been such a handful.

264
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:33,625
Lately, she doesn't want to read.

265
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:35,708
She'd rather do her nails.

266
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,875
OLYMPOS

267
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,500
And talk about boys with bangs.

268
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:43,291
-What does she see in that cabbage head?
-Cabbage?

269
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:48,583
How have you been, big brother?

270
00:23:49,458 --> 00:23:51,125
Same old, same old.

271
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:53,458
Hey, Harumichi.

272
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:55,875
-Yes?
-Where should we go?

273
00:23:56,708 --> 00:24:00,625
Anywhere you want to go!

274
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:01,958
Anywhere?!

275
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,958
Where do you want to go?

276
00:24:22,583 --> 00:24:24,250
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

277
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:26,416
What size does this come in?

278
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:40,750
Welcome.

279
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:50,125
You're welcome to try it.

280
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:52,625
Thank you.

281
00:25:03,541 --> 00:25:04,375
Here you go.

282
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:06,041
Thank you.

283
00:25:19,291 --> 00:25:20,166
TSUZURU

284
00:25:21,458 --> 00:25:22,916
Is it a gift?

285
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:24,791
No.

286
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:26,916
I'm sorry.

287
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:28,875
Thank you.

288
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:54,125
There he is!

289
00:25:55,958 --> 00:25:56,791
Tsuzuru!

290
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:05,125
You wore that last time.

291
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:06,125
Did I?

292
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:11,208
Your hair got longer, huh?

293
00:26:11,291 --> 00:26:12,125
Did it?

294
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:13,833
Yeah.

295
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:15,458
It's down to here.

296
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:17,166
You should trim your bangs.

297
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:20,958
You shouldn't hide your face.

298
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:22,958
Right?

299
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:47,958
Do you remember that shirt you liked?

300
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:49,541
The one with blue stripes.

301
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,416
You wouldn't go out
if you didn't have that.

302
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,958
It was tough on laundry days.

303
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:00,125
Really?

304
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:03,125
Yeah, I even have proof.

305
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:04,041
It's on video.

306
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:05,000
I see.

307
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,833
Ready?

308
00:27:16,458 --> 00:27:17,625
Thank you for the food.

309
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:30,708
I can't eat this much.

310
00:27:30,791 --> 00:27:33,083
It's the tastiest part.

311
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:47,750
How is it?

312
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:49,750
It's good.

313
00:27:49,833 --> 00:27:50,750
Good.

314
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:57,541
Huh? You're going out?

315
00:27:58,125 --> 00:27:58,958
I'll be back.

316
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:00,041
Now?

317
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:01,875
I'll be back by 9:00.

318
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:02,833
Bye.

319
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,791
-Hey!
-Sorry.

320
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:40,166
HIKARU UTADA "HATSUKOI"

321
00:28:57,125 --> 00:29:01,416
TSUZURU'S BIRTHDAY!

322
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:10,541
Don't tell me you stood them up?

323
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:13,750
I got a sudden stomachache.

324
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:16,791
It's been five years?

325
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:18,583
Seven.

326
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:20,541
Unbelievable.

327
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:23,416
Don't come crawling to me
if Tsunemi dumps you.

328
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,875
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

329
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:33,916
-Yay!
-Very cute.

330
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:35,916
What?

331
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,375
That number.

332
00:29:38,458 --> 00:29:39,833
1 2 0 9.

333
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,875
That's a breach of privacy.

334
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:48,625
It's her birthday, isn't it?

335
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:50,708
-Are you still…
-It's not like…

336
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,750
There's no deep meaning.

337
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:57,500
Just that nobody would figure it out
if I lost it.

338
00:29:57,583 --> 00:29:59,833
Uh-huh.

339
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:07,291
Harumichi!

340
00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:09,458
Airu!

341
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:11,500
So cute!

342
00:30:31,291 --> 00:30:32,958
Thank you.

343
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,500
Ms. Noguchi!

344
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:37,458
Yes?

345
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:43,750
D-D… D…

346
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:45,458
D-Do you…

347
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:48,375
have a favorite food?

348
00:30:48,458 --> 00:30:49,291
Huh?

349
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:55,291
Never mind!

350
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:06,833
I got asked my favorite food.

351
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:16,416
I think asking someone
what favorite food is

352
00:31:18,541 --> 00:31:20,750
means that you like that person, right?

353
00:31:34,541 --> 00:31:36,083
Then what about you?

354
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,875
What's your favorite food?

355
00:31:40,916 --> 00:31:41,875
Me?!

356
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:47,333
Naporitan.

357
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:53,958
I see.

358
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:55,916
See you later.

359
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:00,500
Huh?

360
00:32:06,416 --> 00:32:08,583
She was confessing her feelings.

361
00:32:09,541 --> 00:32:10,375
Huh?

362
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:11,625
What do you mean?

363
00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:15,666
Huh?

364
00:32:19,208 --> 00:32:20,416
You stupid?

365
00:32:23,708 --> 00:32:25,583
Do you understand context?

366
00:32:25,666 --> 00:32:27,083
Context.

367
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:29,625
Say someone said, "I bought a bass."

368
00:32:29,708 --> 00:32:33,041
But before that they mentioned,
"grocery store," then this bass is…

369
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:35,708
A fish.

370
00:32:35,791 --> 00:32:36,875
Yes.

371
00:32:36,958 --> 00:32:39,083
Before asking you your favorite food,

372
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:42,250
you were talking about
how it means you like that person.

373
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:44,791
Then that's not a question,
it's a confession!

374
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:46,625
That's freaking context.

375
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:49,375
Even a high school dropout like me
would know that.

376
00:32:51,791 --> 00:32:56,875
Chicken!

377
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:01,666
Chicken.

378
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:27,500
Jeez, you're late.

379
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:28,791
Sorry.

380
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:32,125
The holiday's got us short-handed.

381
00:33:35,791 --> 00:33:40,000
<i>Happy birthday, Yae</i>

382
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:45,958
<i>Happy birthday, Yae</i>

383
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:53,541
<i>Happy birthday, dear Yae</i>

384
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,708
There.

385
00:33:57,791 --> 00:34:04,791
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

386
00:34:05,958 --> 00:34:07,250
Congratulations, Yae.

387
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:08,458
Thank you.

388
00:34:09,791 --> 00:34:11,625
Let me guess, leftovers from work?

389
00:34:11,708 --> 00:34:13,291
How rude!

390
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:16,250
This is from first-class.

391
00:34:16,333 --> 00:34:18,958
Hideki Matsui's eaten this.

392
00:34:19,041 --> 00:34:19,875
Probably.

393
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:23,041
Then I humbly accept.

394
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:32,541
So sweet!

395
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:33,750
Is it sweet?

396
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,625
<i>Our next song is from a new artist</i>
<i>debuting today.</i>

397
00:34:47,708 --> 00:34:52,416
<i>At the age of 15, this singer-songwriter</i>
<i>is gaining a lot of attention.</i>

398
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,583
<i>This is Hikaru Utada with "Automatic."</i>

399
00:34:54,666 --> 00:34:58,458
Which means, she's the same age as you.

400
00:34:58,541 --> 00:35:00,750
Wow, that's impressive.

401
00:35:03,791 --> 00:35:06,791
Kids these days are something else.

402
00:35:08,291 --> 00:35:09,375
Hey.

403
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:11,291
He said this was "<i>Automatic</i>"?

404
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:13,666
What does that mean?

405
00:35:14,958 --> 00:35:16,083
Moves on its own.

406
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:17,250
On its own?

407
00:35:17,833 --> 00:35:21,375
Ah, speaking of moving on its own,

408
00:35:21,458 --> 00:35:25,750
the vending machine at the factory
just raised their prices.

409
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:29,250
I know the sales tax
went up to five percent,

410
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:33,333
but how does a 100-yen coffee
suddenly jump up to 120 yen?

411
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,708
<i>Mommy!</i>

412
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:41,166
<i>I'll spin you around. Give me your hand.</i>

413
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:43,541
<i>Give me your hand, let's spin!</i>

414
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:44,708
<i>Look this way!</i>

415
00:35:58,916 --> 00:36:01,541
<i>There's a big one stuck here.</i>

416
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:02,625
<i>A big one?</i>

417
00:36:03,125 --> 00:36:04,333
<i>Look! See?</i>

418
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:10,750
ARE YOU ON YOUR WAY HOME? ARE YOU OKAY?

419
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,416
Could you head towards the national route?

420
00:37:27,583 --> 00:37:30,000
LIVESTREAM STARTED

421
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,500
Sir, is this the TV tower?

422
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:34,541
I'm not sure.

423
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:37,333
It's the TV tower
from the north side of the 12.

424
00:37:37,416 --> 00:37:40,708
Could you take a u-turn there
and head towards Sapporo?

425
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:42,375
Ishikari Kaido is closed,

426
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:47,041
so please go south on the one way street
on 3rd and head to Kitaichijo.

427
00:37:48,041 --> 00:37:48,958
Okay…

428
00:37:49,541 --> 00:37:50,375
Right there.

429
00:37:57,958 --> 00:38:00,416
HIKARU UTADA "HATSUKOI"

430
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:17,125
I'm sorry.

431
00:38:28,583 --> 00:38:30,000
How did you find me?

432
00:38:32,958 --> 00:38:34,708
A taxi driver's instincts?

433
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:39,375
And sorry.

434
00:38:40,041 --> 00:38:42,500
I looked at your friend's Instagram.

435
00:38:46,708 --> 00:38:47,625
Your girlfriend?

436
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:56,041
She probably just thinks I'm a fan
who hits like on all her posts.

437
00:38:57,958 --> 00:38:59,958
I thought I could meet her here.

438
00:39:00,791 --> 00:39:02,083
I was too late.

439
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:05,375
She's lovely, isn't she?

440
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:23,708
Here, before I forget.

441
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:31,291
I didn't know what to get you.

442
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,625
Happy birthday.

443
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:42,291
Thank you.

444
00:39:55,125 --> 00:39:57,291
What? You want me to listen?

445
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:00,625
What is this?

446
00:40:26,666 --> 00:40:27,916
It's beautiful.

447
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:32,125
I wrote it with her in mind.

448
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:34,000
This?!

449
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:37,041
You made it?! This?! That's amazing!

450
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:38,458
That's so amazing!

451
00:40:39,166 --> 00:40:40,541
Anybody could make this.

452
00:40:40,625 --> 00:40:41,500
No they couldn't!

453
00:40:41,583 --> 00:40:43,041
This is amazing!

454
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:44,791
You're a genius!

455
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:45,750
Wow!

456
00:40:45,833 --> 00:40:47,125
Anyone can make it.

457
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:50,916
I love this song.

458
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:54,875
Best song this year.

459
00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:56,125
Best this year?

460
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,125
<i>Three lucky requesters</i>

463

Stop! Drop me off here!

464
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,166
What? You're being crazy. Not yet.

465
00:41:15,958 --> 00:41:17,083
What is it?

466
00:41:21,708 --> 00:41:22,791
What?

467
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:32,125
Namiki?

468
00:41:32,208 --> 00:41:33,250
What's wrong?

469
00:41:33,333 --> 00:41:34,875
You'll catch a cold.

470
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:54,625
Namiki?

471
00:41:55,625 --> 00:41:56,958
What about you, Noguchi?

472
00:41:58,458 --> 00:41:59,291
What?

473
00:41:59,958 --> 00:42:01,208
What is…

474
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:08,208
your favorite food?

475
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:09,833
What is it?

476
00:42:12,166 --> 00:42:13,375
Shrimp.

477
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:23,791
I like you.

478
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:27,791
Ever since we first met.

479
00:42:30,875 --> 00:42:31,791
Please…

480
00:42:32,541 --> 00:42:33,750
go out with me.

481
00:42:37,041 --> 00:42:37,916
Okay.

482
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:42,083
Me too.

483
00:42:44,958 --> 00:42:46,791
Namiki, I…

484
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:49,541
like you too.

485
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:55,541
<i>…was the flavor of cigarettes</i>

486
00:42:55,625 --> 00:43:01,666
<i>A bitter taste</i>

487
00:43:07,958 --> 00:43:08,791
Hey.

488
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:11,583
You little punk ass.

489
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:17,125
If you're gonna smoke,
be more sneaky about it.

490
00:43:20,458 --> 00:43:21,500
Yes, ma'am.

491
00:43:21,583 --> 00:43:22,916
And also…

492
00:43:25,791 --> 00:43:27,875
Just promise me one thing.

493
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,625
Bring her back before midnight
no matter what.

494
00:43:34,208 --> 00:43:36,833
If you knock her up, I'll kill you.

495
00:43:37,791 --> 00:43:38,750
Yes, ma'am!

496
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:44,291
<i>I'll remember to love</i>
<i>You taught me how</i>

497

<i>So many things I don't want to forget</i>

503
00:44:33,625 --> 00:44:34,875
I'll do that.

504
00:44:34,958 --> 00:44:37,625
-Oh, okay then. Thanks.
-No prob.

Follow that taxi!

-It's too late, sir.
-Hurry!

520
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:52,666
